# Purpose
We have developped Ohmwards to help our client, who is a robotics teacher to prototype cicuits with full voltage, current and resistance calculations. The application features an intuitive account system where user can create and login to accounts as well as view the accounts they have created.

# How to Build
Requirements:
- JDK 25
- Apache Netbeans

# Future Plans
Improve gird system so that it can expand to create bigger circuits as well as a zoom in and zoom out features to improve the look and feel of the application. We also plan to improve the accounts feature so that the program can save circuits for users to pick up from where they left off. Additionally some measures to increase account safety would be nice by creating a build-in encryption system and separation of data from user. Finally, more components could be added to improve real world application of the software as well as improving the GUI through making components appear as their schematic rather than a simple button with text on it.
