- User is prompted to provide an existing username and password 
- If failed user is reprompted or redirected to signup
- If successful user is directed to the projects page

User can pick among existing projects linked to the user and a new project button
- If no projects exist they are not shown
- If new project is clicked, user is redirected to the circuit screen as long as the user does not exceed 5 current projects 

User is given an empty circuit diagram: 
- Users can place components using the add button (battery, wire, led, resistor) on the plane and attach other components together. 
- Once the circuit hits the requirements (closed, has a power source, etc.. ) a display will pop up with the voltage, current, resistance and power in the circuit. 

Clicking on a Component: 
- User is shown a menu where they can change the components characteristics (specific to that component) 
- Most components can change name, colour, and resistance. 
- Ex. Changing the resistance of a potentiometer. 

Deleting a component:
- In the component menu, the users are able to delete the component from their circuit, doing so deletes the component and leaves the circuit open. 


Finishing the Circuit:
- Once the circuit is done, users can press the finish button and save the circuit to be able to view it upon the next login.
- Returns user to the projects screen  
- The circuit cannot be saved if it is not closed 
- Reprompts user to close the circuit
